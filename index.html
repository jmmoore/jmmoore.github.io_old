                    This is a very basic placeholder for this site. I am somewhat bad at updating things after the initial commit, so I wanted to get this to a point where I wouldn't be totally ashamed to show it to someone before I move on.

                    The overarching goal of this site is to be a place I can put on a business card, that will tell the people I meet who I am, what I've done, and how to reach me more directly. Coalesce my online presence, if you will. I do intend to flesh out the site as my needs grow, to occasionally post articles, promote projects I'm working on, and add a dynamically-generated resume.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Wish me luck!
