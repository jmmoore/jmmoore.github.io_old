    <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLbR80pIqY">It's alright not to feel okay</a></h3>

<p>It's been almost seven weeks since I've worked for pay.</p>

<p>I haven't been out of work for this long at any point in my employment history. The experience been alternately freeing and frustrating, in a number of different ways.</p>

<p>Freeing in that:</p>

<ul>
<li>I don't have to worry about company or interpersonal politics.</li>
<li>I don't have to work on uninspiring projects.</li>
<li>I don't have to work with uninspiring people.</li>
<li>If I want to take a break in the middle of the day for a couple hours, I can.</li>
<li>I can wear pajamas all day.</li>
<li>I don't have to really worry about a team lead or manager breathing down my neck.</li>
<li>I can wake up naturally.</li>
<li>I get to set my own schedule.</li>
</ul>

<p>Frustrating in that:</p>

<ul>
<li>I get to set my own schedule, which consumes a lot of energy.</li>
<li>No one is expecting anything of me. All of the standards I have are self-imposed.</li>
<li>I am not generating income.</li>
<li>I have to rely on the state unemployment system.</li>
<li>Every expenditure must be scrutinized more closely than ever.</li>
<li>Being social is difficult as finding free things to do is not always easy.</li>
<li>Dating is difficult for a number of reasons, not the least of which is having money to go on dates.</li>
<li>A lot of uncertainty is added to every day.</li>
<li>A lot of work is involved in trying to find work.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Slump</h3>

<p>Over the last week or so, a kind of ennui has set in. It began on Saturday after having breakfast with D. I journaled for a while, and then sat down and played video games for the rest of the day. Repeat for Sunday, except with some cooking and socializing with parents. By Monday morning, during which I had a minor financial crisis, I had reached peak Can't Even.</p>

<p>The few responses I've gotten in terms of work have been uninspiring and disheartening. This among other things has led to a reclusive and depressing headspace.</p>

<p>I'm also still struggling with how exactly I wish to earn a living. The dream is to do so with words, through writing or speaking or teaching. However, my resume and experience indicate a person with Development and DevOps skills. This kind of work is far more in demand, generally pays better and has more stability.</p>

<h3>Help is Within Reach</h3>

<p>On Tuesday, I reached out to my support network. They helped me expand on some ideas and provided some valuable advice regarding my malaise. Advice that I had read and heard before, but as Samuel Johnson said,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"People need to be reminded more often than they need to be instructed."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They reminded me of simple but not easy things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set a few small, achievable daily goals.</li>
<li>Write a rough schedule for your day.</li>
<li>Get some exercise.</li>
<li>Remember to eat.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overcoming the Slump</h3>

<p>My current strategy is to pursue DevOps/Developer work while continuing to write every day. Doing work and gaining experience in this field will provide a lot of grist for the personal writing mill, not to mention a lot of opportunities to write in other capacities. Technical manuals and documentation don't write themselves.</p>

<p>Going forward in this space you'll see progress on this front. Writing about:</p>

<ul>
<li>Falling back in love with code</li>
<li>Provisioning a Development Environment with Ansible</li>
<li>Minimal, simple websites with HTML5</li>
<li>Writing JavaScript with Kotlin</li>
<li>Creating and linking databases with SQLite</li>
<li>Lessons learned from books and video games</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope that you'll come along with me.</p>
