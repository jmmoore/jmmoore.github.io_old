    <p>Today I watched a video on Giant Bomb dot com, my primary source for information about video games and the video games industry. Today they covered a game called <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/videos/quick-look-gigantic/2300-12388/">Gigantic</a>, a multiplayer action game not dissimilar to Smite or Battleborn.</p>

<p>I was drawn in initially by the minimalist menu design, contrasted with the high-saturation look of the characters. The gameplay resembles a MOBA like Dota or League of Legends but with a much stronger focus on coordinated action, less focus on micromanagement like last hits, item purchase optimization, et cetera.</p>

<p>The game is free to play and I've downloaded it from Steam, but have yet to launch it. I worry that the multiplayer nature of the game will prevent me from embracing it fully. Games like this reach their zenith when accompanied by a group of like-minded friends, together as much to have a good time as to actually play the game.</p>

<p>The gaming community I'm the most active in is the fighting game community, and while there are some good folks there, not a ton of them play on the PC or are interested in an experience like this.</p>

<p>I will still be diving into the game and playing with randomly matched 'pubbies', but I wonder if it will last.</p>

<p>My other concern is with the longevity of the game. The long tail has affected multiplayer games too, leading to a few massive success stories (Overwatch, Player Unknown's Battlegrounds) and the vast majority of games seeing their servers go silent with frightening speed.</p>

<p>This is not a new phenomenon. How many MMORPGs appeared and died in World of Warcraft's shadow? How many first person shooters have landed with a wet thud when competing against Call of Duty or Battlefield?</p>

<p>I'm in a weird spot in terms of my relationship with video games. I've loved them since I was a child. My earliest memories are playing bad NES games with my brother. Over the last few months, though, I've found that I have been coming to video games as an opiate for day to day living.</p>

<p>I don't approach them with a sense of play or joy or exploration as much as I do obligation, or as a way to pass the time, or catch up on podcasts.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is a result of being unemployed, or being self-taught as a programmer and writer. It's difficult to overcome feelings of regret and/or guilt when I do things that aren't immediately or directly applicable to gaining a skill or finding meaningful work.</p>

<p>This is a vein that will require deeper exploration. Enough navelgazing for today.</p>
