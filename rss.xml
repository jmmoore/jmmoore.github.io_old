                <title>On 'Big Boy' Hosting</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<h2>Entering the Digital Ocean</h2>

<p>As my primary task for today I registered with Digital Ocean and migrated jacobmoore.cool from free Github Pages hosting to a small Ubuntu droplet.</p>

<p>A couple of advantages to this approach:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Security.</strong> GitHub Pages doesn't currently support SSL certificates. Moving to my own hosting makes this trivial.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Knowledge.</strong> Setting up an Ubuntu droplet from scratch was a nice exercise. Using a statically generated site means that the process isn't too intense, but writing nginx config files and configuring DNS isn't nothing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scale.</strong> I have a few other web projects planned, specifically one around the Cube League I run. Running an nginx host on my own droplet means that I will be able to host multiple small domains. GitHub Pages is free, but only allows for one site per username or project.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Work.</strong> Making some daily effort toward a larger goal is the single greatest way to achieve the things that we set out to do. Starting this project today gave me momentum and some fodder for this post.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Check back tomorrow for some extended thoughts about GitHub and why I'll be moving to GitLab sooner rather than later.</p>

                <title>On Side Projects</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<h2>Employment, or: The Gilded Cage</h2>

<p>One of the downsides of working for a company with private code repositories is that much of your work is impossible to access once you leave. Even if you're proactive and keep personal copies of your code or other contributions, a couple of problems present themselves:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Context.</strong> A single method, class, or function is more or less meaningless without being able to see the surrounding code. The same goes with a technical document. Seeing one page of a help site can provide some insight into a writer's raw ability, but without a site map or full wiki access, seeing how they work with others or to a style guide simply isn't possible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Disclosure.</strong> Even if you have copies of your work for your previous company, it may be in violation of the terms of your employment to share it. Many employers have strict non-disclosure agreements that cover any work done on their payroll. Perhaps it's possible to alter the work so that it only remotely resembles the original, but undertake any venture of this nature at your own discretion.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Given these strictures, what's the most useful course of action? How is it possible to display one's prowess to potential employers or clients without either violating an NDA or hosting a scattershot repository of contextless code snippets?</p>

<p>The answer is simple, but not easy: <em>a side project</em>.</p>

<h2>The Tyranny of Time</h2>

<p>I accept and understand that many folks simply don't have the time, passion or energy to create a side project, much less maintain and add to one.</p>

<p>People have other responsibilities: to their spouses, parents, children, second jobs, what have you. I will say, though, that there isn't much that's more attractive to a potential employer than being able to see complete and operational code on a github repository or a personal webpage.</p>

<h2>The Reality of Portfolios</h2>

<p>Relying on a resume alone is a long row to hoe when looking for work as a developer or creative person. Without a portfolio, an artist or graphic designer has basically no shot at getting paying work. It's practically a prerequisite for any kind of legitimacy as a professional. The same holds true for developers and writers too.</p>

<p>It's certainly <em>possible</em> to get paying work as a developer or writer without a lot of experience. My own history is proof of that. However, my case relied upon:</p>

<ul>
<li>Being in the right place at the right time </li>
<li>Having a strong network that allowed me to get an audience with an employer</li>
<li>Being able to impress that person enough to hire me based on my rhetoric</li>
</ul>

<p>Needless to say, it took a lot of luck (and undeniably some privilege) to get work where and when I did.</p>

<h2>So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?</h2>

<p>There have been reams and reams of virtual ink spilled onto the internet about how to create side projects, so I'll (mostly) leave it to you to navigate the endless sea of advice on the subject. You'll stumble upon a piece on Medium or their personal blog that resonates with you, and that advice is the place to begin.</p>

<p>If this is that place, I'll first give you my thanks, and then a couple of short thoughts on the matter:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>You likely already have an idea for a side project.</strong> If you have a hobby or interest that you pursue, it's entirely possible that a side project is staring you in the face. Do you knit? Write some code that displays knitting instructions in full sentences, or as code snippets (k5 as a loop, kyok as a function call, etc). Are you into baseball? Convert a box score into an inning-by-inning breakdown of the game, or write an api for a database of a particular player's statistics. Take a database of names and places from the Game of Thrones universe and generate a literal Fantasy League.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use this opportunity to learn something new.</strong> My core idea about how to start a side project stems from James Altucher's concept of 'idea sex'. Take a few things you like and jam them together. Want to learn React? Take an interest of yours and find a tiny thing within that interest. Take that tiny thing and make a tiny React app. Something that performs and renders a simple calculation, or makes a call to a public API.</p>

<p>Combining your entertainment interests with your professional interests is an intersection that leads to a great deal of inspiration.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It's all additive.</strong> I think that a lot of people, myself included, think of a side project like a baby horse. It pops out basically fully formed, can walk almost immediately. There are a few problems with this analogy, but bear with me. Even if you spend four or five hours over a week working on a project and decide to trash it, that in itself is an opportunity!</p>

<p>Write a blogpost, or (if you're not into practicing publicly) a private journal entry, about how you spent those four hours. What you tried, how you failed and what you intend to do moving forward. This post-mortem analysis is so, so useful. It forces you to collate your thoughts and reflect. Hell, your reflection may uncover a solution to the problem you set out to solve in the first place!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The best time to start is yesterday. The next best time to start is right now.</strong> Exactly like the proverb about planting a tree. Make a commitment to yourself to spend a small amount of time every day thinking about and working on the project. 15 minutes, 30 minutes. Even if that time is spent staring at a blank piece of paper, agonizing about the fact that you have no actionable ideas.</p>

<p>The mere fact that your ass is in a chair with the intent of 'make a neat thing' puts you far ahead of everyone rewatching the same show they've seen four times already, or playing a game that they only kind of enjoy just as a way to pass the time. I have been this exact person for a lot of my life.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Splinters and Planks</h2>

<p>I'll be the first to admit that I am terrible at following my own advice. My attempts to make side projects or portfolio projects have ended with losing focus or interest, moving onto a new thing or hitting a roadblock and giving up.</p>

<p>In an effort to address this shortcoming, I am making a commitment to myself to update this blog every weekday, starting with today, with this post.</p>

                <title>On False Dichotomies</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<h3>Why Not Both?</h3>

<p>In <a href="/posts/2017-06-21-on-unemployment-malaise.html">my last post</a>, I said the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The dream is to [make a living] with words, through writing or speaking or teaching. <br/>However, my resume and experience indicate a person with Development and DevOps skills.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The truth of the matter is that writing is a valuable skill to have in life generally. There's no reason that one cannot be and do both.</p>

<p>Here are just some of the things that a developer can write:</p>

<ul>
<li>Technical Blog Posts

<ul>
<li>Failure Post-Mortems</li>
<li>Success Post-Mortems</li>
<li>Tips and Tricks</li>
<li>Tutorials</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Patch Notes</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Tech Talks</li>
<li>Reviews

<ul>
<li>Conference Overview</li>
<li>Software Review</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>This doesn't even cover personal writing, like a book or game review, or a general opinion piece.</p>

<p>Like most of my writing, this is as much a message to myself as it is to anyone reading it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Take some time every day to express yourself with words. It's easier and more valuable than you think.</p>
</blockquote>

                <title>On Unemployment Malaise</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLbR80pIqY">It's alright not to feel okay</a></h3>

<p>It's been almost seven weeks since I've worked for pay.</p>

<p>I haven't been out of work for this long at any point in my employment history. The experience been alternately freeing and frustrating, in a number of different ways.</p>

<p>Freeing in that:</p>

<ul>
<li>I don't have to worry about company or interpersonal politics.</li>
<li>I don't have to work on uninspiring projects.</li>
<li>I don't have to work with uninspiring people.</li>
<li>If I want to take a break in the middle of the day for a couple hours, I can.</li>
<li>I can wear pajamas all day.</li>
<li>I don't have to really worry about a team lead or manager breathing down my neck.</li>
<li>I can wake up naturally.</li>
<li>I get to set my own schedule.</li>
</ul>

<p>Frustrating in that:</p>

<ul>
<li>I get to set my own schedule, which consumes a lot of energy.</li>
<li>No one is expecting anything of me. All of the standards I have are self-imposed.</li>
<li>I am not generating income.</li>
<li>I have to rely on the state unemployment system.</li>
<li>Every expenditure must be scrutinized more closely than ever.</li>
<li>Being social is difficult as finding free things to do is not always easy.</li>
<li>Dating is difficult for a number of reasons, not the least of which is having money to go on dates.</li>
<li>A lot of uncertainty is added to every day.</li>
<li>A lot of work is involved in trying to find work.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Slump</h3>

<p>Over the last week or so, a kind of ennui has set in. It began on Saturday after having breakfast with D. I journaled for a while, and then sat down and played video games for the rest of the day. Repeat for Sunday, except with some cooking and socializing with parents. By Monday morning, during which I had a minor financial crisis, I had reached peak Can't Even.</p>

<p>The few responses I've gotten in terms of work have been uninspiring and disheartening. This among other things has led to a reclusive and depressing headspace.</p>

<p>I'm also still struggling with how exactly I wish to earn a living. The dream is to do so with words, through writing or speaking or teaching. However, my resume and experience indicate a person with Development and DevOps skills. This kind of work is far more in demand, generally pays better and has more stability.</p>

<h3>Help is Within Reach</h3>

<p>On Tuesday, I reached out to my support network. They helped me expand on some ideas and provided some valuable advice regarding my malaise. Advice that I had read and heard before, but as Samuel Johnson said,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"People need to be reminded more often than they need to be instructed."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They reminded me of simple but not easy things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set a few small, achievable daily goals.</li>
<li>Write a rough schedule for your day.</li>
<li>Get some exercise.</li>
<li>Remember to eat.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overcoming the Slump</h3>

<p>My current strategy is to pursue DevOps/Developer work while continuing to write every day. Doing work and gaining experience in this field will provide a lot of grist for the personal writing mill, not to mention a lot of opportunities to write in other capacities. Technical manuals and documentation don't write themselves.</p>

<p>Going forward in this space you'll see progress on this front. Writing about:</p>

<ul>
<li>Falling back in love with code</li>
<li>Provisioning a Development Environment with Ansible</li>
<li>Minimal, simple websites with HTML5</li>
<li>Writing JavaScript with Kotlin</li>
<li>Creating and linking databases with SQLite</li>
<li>Lessons learned from books and video games</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope that you'll come along with me.</p>

                <title>On Stubbornness and Grit</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>I just finished reading Chapter 4 of Jeff Goins's book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Real-Artists-Dont-Starve-Strategies/dp/0718086260/"><em>Real Artists</em> Don't <em>Starve</em></a>. It begins with a quote from Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com:</p>

<p>"We are stubborn on vision. We are flexible on details."</p>

<p>Goins starts the meat of the chapter with the story of F. Scott Fitzgerald, who persevered through hundreds of denials and rejections on the way to publishing his first novel.</p>

<p>Partially because of this perseverance, Fitzgerald grew into an incredible success, only to become results-oriented and focus too strongly on the critical and business reception of his work.</p>

<p>This led to discouragement and giving up.</br> 
Fitzgerald died at 44 of heart failure, mostly penniless.</p>

<p>Goins goes on in the chapter to define when exactly an artist should be stubborn and when they should not. The concept of grit is discussed at length.</p>

<p>I can empathize with discouragement and giving up. This kind of grit, pushing through adversity and failure for a longer-term view of success, was never something that I had to have.</p>

<p>My mom read to my brother and I from a very, very young age. The ability to take in and internalize new information grew from this learning. School was always easy, and when it got hard, I gave up.</p>

<p>In high school, I had a C in AP Chemistry. Partially to avoid difficulty and partially in an effort to graduate early, I dropped AP Chem at winter break and took on a much easier courseload.</p>

<p>This pattern of giving up when it gets hard has repeated itself several times throughout my adult life. I have been unemployed for over a month, and have taken on only a couple of new challenges. I have lost inertia. I wouldn't quite say that I'm depressed, but I have definitely felt rudderless.</p>

<p>I feel stuck between a few different paths:</p>

<ul>
<li>Continue to learn programming and web development, finding an entry-level job at a software company.</li>
<li>Pursue the artistic and creative dream of writing for a living.</li>
<li>Brush back up on DevOps-y things like Ansible and Puppet and find work in more of an IT capacity.</li>
</ul>

<p>I experienced the giving up pattern just recently. I was working on a website for the MtG league I run here in Wichita. After being away from the project a couple of days, I jumped back in and quickly felt incredibly overwhelmed by the amount of work that needed to be done. I gave up and dicked around for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>Even as I typed that last paragraph, I was thinking of solutions or strategies that I've heard or read or attempted to implement myself in order to solve those problems.</p>

<p>Grit, from my perspective, is a simple thing. Not easy, but simple.</p>

<ul>
<li>Show up, rain or shine.</li>
<li><a href="https://ryanholiday.net/life-as-a-grand-strategy/">Have a grand strategy.</a></li>
<li>Don't dick around.</li>
<li>Do the work.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's no more complex or noble than that.</p>

<p>Give some thought to this.</br> 
If you're experiencing doubt or want to give up, don't give up just yet. </br>
Consider another way forward.</br> 
Take the problem you're facing down,</br>
break it into smaller pieces.</p>

<p>How small?</p>

<p>This small.</br>
Two words.</br>
Maybe three words.</br>
Four if you must.</br>
Get specific.</p>

<p>Nearly every problem we face </br>
can be addressed with</br>
the right mindset.</br>
The right outlook.</p>

<p>The cliche goes</br> 
"The only person holding me back is me."</br>
This is both true and not true.</p>

<p>You are holding yourself back.</br>
But it's not all of you.</br>
It's the parts of you that are afraid.</br>
That are doubtful.</br>
That are hateful.</br>
Voices that you've heard and remembered.</br>
Voices that sound a lot like yours.</br>
Listen to them.</br>
Acknowledge their existence.</br>
Then move on with your life.</br>
Meditation helps.</br>
Silence helps.</p>

<p>Return to the bullets above.</br>
Show up.</br>
Have a plan.</br>
Don't fuck around.</br>
Do the work.</p>

<p>It's simple. Not easy.</br>
No one said this would be easy.</p>

<p>Back to the books for me.</p>

<p>Until next time.</p>

                <title>Don't Be Precious</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm not very nice to my books. I dogear the pages, write in the margins, underline passages and sometimes break the spines (never intentionally). It's my quest in life to learn as much as possible, and my path to do that is littered with ruined books.</p>

<p>It wasn't always this way, though.</p>

<h3>Precious Books</h3>

<p>Throughout my adolescence and early adulthood, I revered books. I loved the way they looked on the shelves, the perfect smoothness of a well-handled spine, all of it. My time working at Barnes and Noble put me in the company of a lot of book people. They, like me, held a similar reverence for the printed word.</p>

<p>I looked askance at those who didn't take care of their books. Who didn't dust their shelves, who didn't write in a notebook instead of a margin, who didn't do any of the things I considered necessary for the curator of a library, or the owner of books.</p>

<h3>Homepage Woes</h3>

<p>Fast forward several years. I'm staring at the folder containing my personal webpage, my finger hovering over the delete key.</p>

<p>I want to keep it so badly.</p>

<p>But I can't. It's getting in the way.</p>

<p>I had spent the better part of the last week trying to integrate a statically generated blog onto the website. For a long time, I heard calls to start a blog from many of my favorite online columnists, and thought "That would be a good thing to do...on another day."</p>

<p>By the time I wanted to actually start a blog, my homepage sat before me, taunting me. I liked its simple look and straightforward design. I agonized for days trying to integrate a blogroll onto the site. I just couldn't make it happen, and it soon became apparent:</p>

<p><strong>I had to kill my webpage to move on with my life.</strong></p>

<h3>Get It Done</h3>

<p>There was no funeral.</p>

<p>In the end, I found a static site generator that I liked and applied a theme that I didn't hate. Kept most of the text from the original homepage for this new one, and moved on with my life.</p>

<p>It comes back to what many people have said, but in my opinion <a href="https://stackingthebricks.com/">Amy Hoy</a> said it best:</p>

<p>Just. Fucking. Ship.</p>

<p>I can tell you from personal experience that you're going to waste an inordinate amount of time and energy trying to make your way around all of these barriers you've set up for yourself.</p>

<p>Instead, consider just shipping. Get something done. Get your energy back.</p>

<p>Move on with your life.</p>

                <title>CSS: Center Multiple Lines on a Shared Character</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>In my work sprucing up <a href="http://collegehillcreative.com/">College Hill Creative</a>'s homepage, I discovered something that bothered me at the bottom of each page. The roster was formatted like so:</p>

<pre><code class="html">&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
    Name Number One | Title Number One&lt;br/&gt;
    Slightly Shorter | Shorter Title&lt;br/&gt;
    Tiny | Tiny&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It rendered like this:</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
    Name Number One | Title Number One<br/>
    Slightly Shorter | Shorter Title<br/>
    Tiny | Tiny<br/>
</p>

<p>The fact that the text wasn't centered on the pipes bothered me significantly, and I went to work trying to fix the issue.</p>

<p>My initial searches led me to attempt to maintain whitespace inside of the p element. This got close, but was too finicky and lacked precision. After spending some additional time trying in vain to solve the problem on my own, I reached out to the <a href="https://devict.org/">devICT</a> Slack channel for help.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.barrettmorgandesignllc.com/">Barrett Morgan</a> offered the following suggestion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>@jmmoore you might try wrapping each side of the pipe in divs that are 50% wide. Then right aligning one side and left aligning the other...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He provided some sample code as well:</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/jmmoore/5Lp1Lq8u/embedded/html,css,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>It rendered relatively close to the way I wanted but the centering still wasn't exactly where I wanted it to be. However, I took his suggestions and spent some time trying different margin combinations. After some experimentation, putting the pipe character inside its own classed div did the trick.</p>

<p>The final version that works is on JSFiddle, embedded below:</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/jmmoore/5suyaqto/embedded/html,css,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>This doesn't strike me as a particularly elegant solution, so if you have solved this problem in a different way, please reach out to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/jmmoore_">Twitter</a>!</p>
